# Task ID: 1
# Title: Refactor use-tasks Hook to Database Package and Integrate with Kanban App
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Move the use-tasks hook from the dashboard app to the database package, export it, and update the Kanban app to use the shared hook while ensuring development sign-in functionality works.
# Details:
This task involves refactoring the existing use-tasks hook to improve code reusability across applications:

1. Identify the current use-tasks hook implementation in the dashboard app
2. Create a new file in the database package to house the refactored hook
3. Move the hook implementation to the database package, ensuring all dependencies are properly imported
4. Update the hook to handle any environment-specific configurations
5. Export the hook from the database package's index file to make it available to consuming applications
6. Update the Kanban app to import the hook from the database package instead of using its local implementation
7. Ensure the development sign-in functionality continues to work with the refactored hook
8. Remove any duplicate hook implementations from the Kanban app
9. Update any imports in the Kanban app that referenced the local hook implementation
10. Verify that all task-related functionality in the Kanban app works with the shared hook

Code considerations:
- Ensure the hook maintains backward compatibility with existing implementations
- Handle any environment-specific configurations that might differ between apps
- Consider adding documentation to the hook to explain its usage
- Ensure proper error handling is maintained during the refactoring
- Check for any app-specific logic that might need to be parameterized in the shared hook

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the use-tasks hook has been successfully moved to the database package:
   - Check that the file exists in the correct location
   - Confirm it's properly exported from the package's index file

2. Verify that the Kanban app correctly imports and uses the shared hook:
   - Check that all imports have been updated
   - Confirm no duplicate implementations remain

3. Test all CRUD operations in the Kanban app to ensure they work correctly with the shared hook:
   - Create a new task and verify it appears in the correct column
   - Read tasks by confirming they load correctly on app initialization
   - Update a task's details and verify changes persist
   - Delete a task and verify it's removed from the UI

4. Test the development sign-in functionality:
   - Verify users can sign in using development credentials
   - Confirm user-specific tasks are loaded correctly after sign-in
   - Check that authentication state is properly maintained

5. Run the existing test suite to ensure no regressions have been introduced

6. Perform cross-browser testing to ensure compatibility is maintained
