      "details": "Implementation steps:\n\n1. Create a KanbanBoard container component:\n   - Implement a responsive grid or flex layout that will house the columns\n   - Add appropriate styling using Tailwind v4.1 classes\n   - Set up state management for columns and tasks (consider using React context or Redux)\n   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality between columns (consider react-beautiful-dnd or dnd-kit)\n\n2. Create a KanbanColumn component:\n   - Design the column header with title and task count\n   - Implement column container with appropriate styling\n   - Add a scrollable task container area\n   - Include \"Add Task\" button/functionality at the bottom of each column\n   - Style using the established design system and Tailwind v4.1\n\n3. Create placeholder components for tasks within columns:\n   - Implement basic task card structure\n   - Include essential task information (title, due date, priority)\n   - Add hover and active states\n   - Ensure accessibility compliance\n\n4. Set up the data structure for columns and tasks:\n   - Define interfaces/types for columns and tasks\n   - Create mock data for initial development and testing\n   - Prepare API integration points for future backend connection\n\n5. Implement basic column actions:\n   - Add column functionality\n   - Column title editing\n   - Prepare for column reordering (will be fully implemented in Task #9)\n\n6. Ensure components are modular and reusable:\n   - Use proper component composition\n   - Implement appropriate prop interfaces\n   - Document component usage and props\n\n7. Optimize for performance:\n   - Use React.memo where appropriate\n   - Implement virtualization for large task lists\n   - Consider lazy loading for columns with many tasks",
      "testStrategy": "1. Component Rendering Tests:\n   - Verify KanbanBoard renders correctly with multiple columns\n   - Ensure KanbanColumn renders with proper header, task container, and footer\n   - Test that task placeholders render correctly within columns\n\n2. Functionality Tests:\n   - Test drag-and-drop functionality between columns\n   - Verify column addition works correctly\n   - Test column title editing functionality\n   - Ensure task count updates appropriately\n\n3. Responsive Design Tests:\n   - Test board and column components at various screen sizes\n   - Verify appropriate wrapping/stacking behavior on mobile devices\n   - Ensure touch interactions work for mobile drag-and-drop\n\n4. Accessibility Tests:\n   - Verify all components have appropriate ARIA attributes\n   - Test keyboard navigation for drag-and-drop functionality\n   - Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards\n\n5. Integration Tests:\n   - Create mock API responses and verify components can handle data properly\n   - Test error states and loading states\n   - Verify state management works correctly across components\n\n6. Performance Tests:\n   - Test rendering performance with a large number of tasks\n   - Verify smooth scrolling within columns\n   - Measure and optimize component re-renders\n\n7. Visual Regression Tests:\n   - Compare screenshots against design system specifications\n   - Verify styling matches the prototype\n   - Test dark/light mode if applicable",
