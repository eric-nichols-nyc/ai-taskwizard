		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up monorepo connections",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of configuring monorepo connections into subtasks such as: (1) Analyze monorepo structure and dependencies, (2) Configure package.json and workspace settings, (3) Set up import paths for database and design-system packages, (4) Implement and verify configuration files, (5) Write and run tests to confirm connections.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves configuring dependencies and ensuring correct imports across packages in a monorepo, which requires understanding workspace tools and resolving potential integration issues. It is moderately complex due to the need for cross-package coordination and verification, but does not involve advanced algorithms or deep business logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create task data model",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks such as: (1) Define the Task interface/type, (2) Align model with database schema requirements, (3) Implement serialization/deserialization logic, (4) Write and execute model validation tests.",
			"reasoning": "Defining a data model is conceptually straightforward but requires attention to type safety, database compatibility, and validation. The complexity is moderate, as it involves both TypeScript and database schema considerations, but the logic is not deeply intricate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement task database operations",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose this task into subtasks such as: (1) Implement create operation, (2) Implement read operation(s), (3) Implement update operation, (4) Implement delete operation, (5) Add error handling and validation, (6) Write unit and integration tests for all operations.",
			"reasoning": "CRUD operations require careful handling of data flow, error cases, and integration with the database package. The need for robust error handling and testing increases the complexity, especially as the code must be reliable and maintainable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create New Task button component",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this down into subtasks such as: (1) Implement the button UI using design system components, (2) Add and test click handler logic, (3) Ensure accessibility and styling compliance.",
			"reasoning": "This is a simple UI component with limited logic, mostly involving rendering and event handling. The complexity is low, with the main considerations being design system usage and accessibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement task form overlay component",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks such as: (1) Implement overlay/modal structure, (2) Integrate open/close logic, (3) Style the overlay according to design system, (4) Add accessibility features (focus trap, keyboard navigation), (5) Write tests for overlay behavior.",
			"reasoning": "Creating an accessible modal overlay involves UI composition, state management, and accessibility concerns. While not algorithmically complex, it requires attention to UX and edge cases, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create task form component",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks such as: (1) Build form fields for task properties, (2) Implement form validation logic, (3) Integrate date picker and other design system components, (4) Add submit and cancel button logic, (5) Ensure accessibility, (6) Write tests for form behavior and validation.",
			"reasoning": "Building a form with validation, state management, and accessibility requires careful implementation. The complexity is increased by the need to handle user input, validation, and integration with design system components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate task creation functionality",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks such as: (1) Compose container component, (2) Connect overlay and form components, (3) Implement submission handler with database integration, (4) Add loading and error states, (5) Handle overlay open/close logic, (6) Test full task creation flow, (7) Ensure state resets after submission.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating multiple components, managing asynchronous operations, handling errors, and ensuring a smooth user experience. The coordination of UI and backend logic increases the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement calendar task display",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks such as: (1) Update calendar component to support task data, (2) Implement data fetching for selected day, (3) Create or update task list component, (4) Add visual indicators for days with tasks, (5) Handle loading and empty states, (6) Write tests for calendar and task display.",
			"reasoning": "Displaying tasks on a calendar involves data fetching, UI updates, and state management. The need to synchronize UI with data and provide visual feedback adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create task list component",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks such as: (1) Implement task list rendering logic, (2) Style the list with Tailwind CSS, (3) Handle empty state display, (4) Write tests for various data scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Rendering a list component is a common UI task with moderate complexity, mainly involving data mapping, styling, and handling empty states."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement real-time calendar updates",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks such as: (1) Set up query cache invalidation, (2) Implement optimistic UI updates, (3) Add visual feedback for task addition, (4) Update calendar indicators in real-time, (5) Handle error recovery for failed updates, (6) Test with simulated network delays, (7) Write integration tests for real-time updates.",
			"reasoning": "Real-time updates require advanced state management, cache synchronization, optimistic UI handling, and robust error recovery. This task is complex due to the need for seamless user experience and handling of asynchronous data flows."
